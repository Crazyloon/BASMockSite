# BASMockSite
Test Environment

This is a mock-up of a site I was asked to make for the BAS director at Renton Tech.
The goal was to design a site which would allow students to learn about each of the different
bachelor's degree options available in the Puget Sound region.

Students would be able to browse and search colleges and programs for more information.
BAS directors from each of the colleges would have access to a page specifically about their college
and programs. They would be able to modify most of the data about their college.
